# Challenge

Hello!

#### We are happy that you are interested in joining our team! We created a challenge based on some skills we use in our daily lives to get to know a little more about you.

# Lottery draw

Write an API using the Java language to manage a lottery draw

Your application should have the following rules:

* The users should have the option to register new
tickets and view all the tickets already registered in their name;
* The price of each ticket should be R$5,00;
* Each bet must contain 5 numbers, but it is possible to add more
numbers at an additional cost of 10% over the previous price;
* The ticket price will be taxed at 15%;
* The numbers available for bet selection must be from 1 to 10;
* The application must allow the user to choose his/her own numbers or
generate random numbers for betting;
* On consulting the result of the lottery, the system must return the
winning user and the total sum and the amount that the winner will receive

> * We recommend to use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) software to test you application 


#### Bonus (optional) :star2:
Write unit tests using [JUnit](https://junit.org/junit5/)


# Submission
Send the URL of a private git repository with your code to `developers@fivevalidation.com`.

For example: [GitHub](https://github.com) or [GitLab](https://gitlab.com).  
* **It needs to be sent with the git collaboration invite to give us access to view your repository.** [How to invite collaborators](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-access-to-your-personal-repositories/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository)


# Good luck!
Our analysis goes beyond the final result, so if you have a problem implementing some detail, send us your solution anyway.

* Evaluation criteria
* Ability to assimilate new content
* Organization
* Attention to requirements
* Dedication to deliver something, even if minimally functional
* **Express what was done through the commit message.** [Good practices](https://github.com/trein/dev-best-practices/wiki/Git-Commit-Best-Practices)
